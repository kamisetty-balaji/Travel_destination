    <h3 id="kyoto">Kyoto Tower,Japan</h3>
    <p>
      Kyoto Tower was proposed in the early 1960s, and it was planned to be
      constructed and completed in time to correspond with the 1964 Summer
      Olympics in Tokyo.[2] Construction began in 1963 on the former site of
      Kyoto's central post office and was completed near the end of 1964.[1]
      Unlike many other towers (such as Tokyo Tower) that are constructed using
      metal lattice frames, Kyoto Tower's interior structure consists of many
      steel rings stacked on top of each other.[4] The structure was then
      covered with lightweight steel sheets with a thickness of 12–22 mm
      (0.47–0.87 in). The sheets were then welded together and painted white.[3]
      The intended overall effect was for the tower to resemble a Japanese
      candle.[4]

    <h3 id="london">London</h3>
    <p>
      The Tower of London, officially His Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of
      the Tower of London, is a historic citadel and castle on the north bank of
      the River Thames in London, England. It lies within the London Borough of
      Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile
      of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was
      founded toward the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White
      Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the
      Conqueror in 1078 and was initially a resented symbol of oppression,
      inflicted upon London by the new Norman ruling class. The castle was also
      used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham) until 1952
      (the Kray twins),[3] although that was not its primary purpose. A grand
      palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole,
      the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric
      rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of
      expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the
      12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th
      century remains despite later activity on the site.
